# Payment-Date-Prediction
## Predicting Payment Dates for invoices using Machine Learning

The dataset used in this project consists of the information of the invoices that are generated for the previous transactions of B2B customers, which includes information 
like Invoice ID, Customer name and their ID, the dates at which the invoices were created, Due Date, the payment Clear Date, Total amount to be paid, Customer Payment terms, 
Business code of that customer, Business year, type of currency used to make the payment, etc..

The task is to apply the Data Pre-processing and Data Cleaning methods to the dataset, and use different Feature Extraction and Feature Engineering techniques, so
that it can be used to train the ML models. Hyper-Parameter Tuning is also done to get the best possible results.

Finally, this ML model can be used for predicting the clear dates for the invoices that are not yet cleared, and these predicted values 
are categorized into aging buckets.
